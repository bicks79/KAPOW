 - Collectors of high quality statues and figurines.
 - Film, TV and Gaming entushaists.
 - Specific fanbases, such as Marvel and DC comics.

### USER STORIES
*To ensure that user needs were met, KAPOW! was created with the following considerations...*

### DESIGN CHOICES
*KAPOW! was created to be visually appealing by implementing the following design choices...*

#### Structure & layout
As an e-commerce site, KAPOW! needed to be structured in a way that would be familiar to users when shopping online.
Providing a positive experience with secure, engaging features would encourage users to return to the site and make future purchases. By employing the use of templates, the basic structure would be in place, and provide a solid platform on which to build the project. The initial idea was to use a template from [Startbootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/).
[Startbootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/), creates free, open source, Bootstrap themes, templates and code snippets for developers to use on their projects. I found two templates in ['Shop Homepage'](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage) and ['Shop Item'](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-item) that were ideal for me to base KAPOW! on.
However, due to time restrictions, I decided to follow the structure and layout from the previous mini project
[Boutique Ado](https://github.com/ckz8780/boutique_ado_v1). While not original, it provided me with the best resource to build my project.


#### Colourscheme
The idea of KAPOW!, was to create a comic book like site that would provide familiarity to its users. 
The colourscheme needed to reflect that, so I played around with the use of bold colours and stark contrast to re-create the 
feel of a comic book.  [RALcolorchart.com](https://www.ralcolorchart.com/), had a wide range of colours to choose from and 
provided HEX, RGB and CMYK code to use.
[imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/), allowed me to use my hero-image as a colour template and I used this to ensure that the button colour matched the KAPOW! red in the hero-image.


### WIREFRAMES
*KAPOW! was structured in the following way...*

## TESTING

### LANGUAGE TESTING

### FRAMEWORK TESTING

### DEBUGGING
-Issue 1
    - Initial setup of the project utilised the most up to date versions of Django/bootstrap.
    However, as I had decided to use the 'Boutique Ado' mini project to help structure my project, 
    it became apparent that some of the functions did not work as both Django and bootstrap had undergone updates.
    To fix this issue, it required reverting to earlier versions of Django/boostrap, and a small tutor
    support session to help ensure that everything would work correctly.

- Issue 2
    - While creating the database for my project, I ran into an issue when trying to upload the products.json file I had created.
    I did not have an issue when loading the previous categories.json file, so the bug had to be located within the code for my products.json file.  I tried various amendments to the file, scanning back over the terminal to find the root cause.  I had very little success so decided to contact tutor support to guide me through the problem as swiftly as possible.
    After going over the issue with tutor support, the issue I was having related to me adding the dimensions field into the file after I had ran migrations.  Once I re-ran migrations, and assigned a random string value to the field, the products file loaded and the problem was resolved.   

- Issue 3
    - When setting up the secure checkout page I had an issue with the positioning of my user details form. This caused me several hours of investigation to find out why the rendering of my form was not successful.  I made the decision  to wipe the checkout.html template clean and start over and see if I had missed anything out from the original code.  I realised on re-coding that I had placed part of the form outside of the parent div and this was causing the code to render incorrectly.
    While this did set me back, it proved a worth while exercise to elimiante a sloppy error.
