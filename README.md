### DEVELOPER GOALS
*As the developer of KAPOW!, the goal is to...*

### USER STORIES

Insert user stories excel sheet here.

### DESIGN CHOICES
*KAPOW! was created to be visually appealing by implementing the following design choices...*

#### Structure & layout
As an e-commerce site, KAPOW! needed to be structured in a way that would be familiar to users when shopping online.
Providing a positive experience with secure, engaging features would encourage users to return to the site and make future purchases. 
By employing the use of templates, the basic structure would be in place, and provide a solid platform on which to build the project.
[Startbootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) creates free, open source, Bootstrap themes, templates, and code snippets for developers 
to use on their projects. I found two templates in ['Shop Homepage'](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage) and 
['Shop Item'](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-item) that were ideal for me to base KAPOW! on.

Insert screencaps of startbootstrap templates here.

#### Colourscheme
The idea of KAPOW!, was to create a comic book like site that would provide familiarity to its users. 
The colourscheme needed to reflect that, so I played around with the use of bold colours and stark contrast to re-create the 
feel of a comic book.  [RALcolorchart.com](https://www.ralcolorchart.com/), had a wide range of colours to choose from and 
provided HEX, RGB and CMYK code to use.

## TESTING
### LANGUAGE TESTING

### FRAMEWORK TESTING

### DEBUGGING
-Issue 1
    -Initial setup of the project utilised the most up to date versions of Django/bootstrap.
    However, as I had decided to use the 'Boutique Ado' mini project to help structure my project, 
    it became apparent that some of the functions did not work as both Django and bootstrap had undergone updates.
    To fix this issue, it required reverting to earlier versions of Django/boostrap, and a small tutor
    support session to help ensure that everything would work correctly.

- Issue 2
    -While creating the database for my project, I ran into an issue when trying to upload the products.json file I had created.
    I did not have an issue when loading the previous categories.json file, so the bug had to be located within the code for my products.json file.  I tried various amendments to the file, scanning back over the terminal to find the root cause.  I had very little success so decided to contact tutor support to guide me through the problem as swiftly as possible.
    After going over the issue with tutor support, the issue I was having related to me adding the dimensions field into the file after I had ran migrations.  Once I re-ran migrations, and assigned a random string value to the field, the products file loaded without issue.
